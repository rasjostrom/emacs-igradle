* igradle-mode
An emacs minor mode for dealing with gradle projects interactively.

** Features
*** Interactive Menu
    *igradle* implements a [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] for interacting with gradle. Using this, it's possible to
     do things like choosing between tasks to execute, list all the gradle tasks available
     in the project, get the gradle project description, etc.

     [[./screenshots/igradle-menu.png]]

     In the case of multi-project structures, the user can select between different
     projects/builds by using the "Set Build File" function. This will locate all
     ~build.gradle~ files starting from the project root directory and prompt the user to
     select one of them.

     A second hydra is also implemented to read the output of gradle. However, this only
     allows for scrolling up/down so far.

     These functions do not have a direct key binding, so must either be bound manually or
     called using ~M-x~. They're all prefixed with ~igradle-~.

**** execute

**** menu
     Opens an interactive hydra interface to gradle.

**** list-tasks
     Lists all gradle tasks available in the current target build.

**** describe-task
     Prompts for a gradle task and describes it using ~gradle help --task <NAME>~.

**** describe-project
     Describes the project using the project description (if available) of the current
     target build.

**** describe-build
     Displays the currently selected target build file in the minibuffer.

**** set-build

** Installation

 To activate igradle, issue ~M-x RET igradle-mode~ or put ~(igradle-mode 1)~ somewhere in
 your emacs config.
